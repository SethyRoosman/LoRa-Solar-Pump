# LoRa-Solar-Pump

<body>
A soil moisture sensor turns a pump on and off with relays but thats not all! The soil moisture data is sent over LoRa to a radio and is all powered through solar!

			<h1>IoT LoRa Pump for use in Automated Greenhouses</h1>
			<p>This was a project I worked on that would provide the framework for an Internet of Things connected automated greenhouse. This program read data off of a soil moisture sensor and, if the water saturation was below a set static threshold, the pump connected to a water jug would turn on and water the soil. After reading the soil moisture value and acting accordingly, the Arduino board would then communicate with a LoRaWAN gateway using an mDot LoRa module. The data could then be seen on The Things Network console (Unfortunately the gateway this project used has been changed so I cannot show an example of the console data).</p>

				<h3><em>Here is how the coding side of this project works</em></h3>
				<img src="LoRa-Pump-Code-RESIZE.png">
				<p>Here is a piece-by-piece breakdown!</p>
				<p>The first part of this program is declaring the variables and telling the Arduino board which sensors are where. We initialize the moisture sensor and subsequent sensors with <code>int sensorOrRelay = pin where sensor <br>is connected</code>. These values are then initialized in the <code>void setup()</code>. We also initialize the mDot module and serial monitor and then send the activation instructions (<code>mDot.println("AT+JOIN");</code>) to make the mDot read instructions from the serial monitor.</p>
				<p>The function <code>int read_water_sensor()</code> turns on the power to the soil moisture sensor and reads a measurement. This measurement is then used in the if/else statement in <code>void loop()</code> and tells the <br>Arduino whether or not it should activate the pump.</p>
				<p>The last little bit of code sends the mDot module instructions and a value to send to the gateway (The value is encoded in UTF-16 to reduce message size because LoRa has incredible range but very little bandwidth). The program then waits 30 seconds before looping back to the top</p>
			</div>
			<h3><em>This is how the sent data (UTF-16) is decoded</em></h3>
			<img src="decoder-resize.png">
			<p>This decoder function takes a list of UTF-16 characters as one of it's parameters. Using a for loop, the program iterates through the list using the String.fromCharCode() method which converts the UTF-16 character into an ASCII one and adds these values to a variable. The program then returns the word "Decoded: " with the variable that stored the characters attached <br>to the end.</p>
